##contenteditable temporary solution
####Temporary Solution for ContentEditable Weirdness with Blaze.

I created a simple solution that caches the target element nodes when the element gets focus. After element loses focus the list of cached nodes is used to remove the nodes that were added while the content was edited.

The solution is contained in **'editor.js'** file. There are 2 methods that you can use in your code: 
* Edit - can be called from 'focus' event handler, caches initial list of nodes, sets contentEditable=true
* Save - should be called from 'blur' event handler, sets contentEditable='inherited', updates content collection document and removes (prunes) the nodes that were added.
 
The example usage: 
```

```

I consider methods 'Cache' and 'Prune' as private.

*The solution is tested on Chrome v37 running on Ubuntu 14.04. Please, give it a try in other environments.*

The content editable problem happens because Blaze has no functionality that would link DOM node added 'manually' with corresponding DOMRange object. I'm looking for a way to create such connection rather than 'prune' nodes. 
If the added node is linked to DOMRange, Blaze would treat them in the same way as nodes generated by template.
